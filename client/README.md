# NYUsed Client

An Electron application based on [Electron React Boilerplate](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/).

## Prerequisite

- Node: `19.2.0`.
- Npm: `8.19.3`.

Note that other versions may also work, but I only tested the above versions.

## Quickstart

1. Install the packages:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
