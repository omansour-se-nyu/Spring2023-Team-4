# NYUsed Server

## Prerequisite

- Java: `8`.
- Maven: `3.8.5`.

Note that other versions may also work, but I only tested the above versions.

## Quickstart

Ensure there is a local MySQL database (version `8.0.31`) running on port `3306` with username `root` and password `123456`.

1. Start the development server:
   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
